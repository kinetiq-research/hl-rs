# Project Overview
* This is a Rust SDK for the Hyperliquid protocol. It is a library for building and signing transactions for the Hyperliquid protocol.
* The Info client is for fetching data.
* The Exchange client is for  submitting actions, of which there are two primary signing types. User signed actions and l1 signed actions


# Design Goals
* Follow proper rust programming practices and patterns for library implementation.
* Ease of use is a priority
* Ease of implementing new actions in the library is a priority

# Inspiration
* https://github.com/alloy-rs - This is the library that we are using to build the SDK. It is a Rust library for building and signing transactions for the Hyperliquid protocol. Reference for good rust programming practices and familiar patterns.



# Reference Material
* https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs?q= - Hyperliquid documentation. Reference for the Hyperliquid protocol and the API.
* https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/ - Implementation in python. Reference for Hyperliquid interfaces and correctness
